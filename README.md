### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I value collaboration and make a living in software, so I'm here on Github, but I also value decentralization and data ownership, so I'm moving my personal repositories to my [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/) instance at https://code.nthall.com/noah.

My [personal site](https://www.nthall.com) has more information about my work and life, and a modest collection of posts about (mostly, so far) technology and birdwatching.
